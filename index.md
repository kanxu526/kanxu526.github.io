I am currently an Assistant Professor of Information Systems at [Arizona State University, W. P. Carey School of Business](https://wpcarey.asu.edu/). Previously, I completed my PhD degree from Department of Economics, University of Pennsylvania. I was fortunately advised by <a href="https://hamsabastani.github.io">Hamsa Bastani</a> from the Operations, Information, and Decisions Department, the Wharton School. I also received a B.S. in Mathematics and a B.A. in Economics from Tsinghua University, and a M.S. in Statistics from University of Chicago.

<p>My research focuses on developing novel machine learning methods for data-driven decision making practices, with applications to healthcare, textual analytics, digital platform, and pricing. In particular, I have designed tools for sequential decision making (e.g., bandits, reinforcement learning), collaborative decision making (e.g., multitask learning, transfer learning), and decision making with unstructured (e.g. natural language processing (NLP)) or matrix form (e.g., matrix completion). </p>

<p>
I am actively looking for self-motivated graduate/undergraduate students. My research projects include design science for Information Systems and machine learning theory for Operations Management. Please feel free to send me an email if you would like to chat about potential opportunities!
