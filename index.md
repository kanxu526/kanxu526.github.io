<p>I am currently an Assistant Professor of Information Systems at <a href="https://wpcarey.asu.edu/">Arizona State University, W. P. Carey School of Business</a>. Previously, I completed my PhD degree from Department of Economics, University of Pennsylvania. I was fortunately advised by <a href="https://hamsabastani.github.io">Hamsa Bastani</a> from the Operations, Information, and Decisions Department, the Wharton School. I also received a B.S. in Mathematics and a B.A. in Economics from Tsinghua University, and a M.S. in Statistics from University of Chicago. </p>

<p>My research lies at the intersection of machine learning and business analytics. I develop novel machine learning and deep learning methods that establish theoretical foundations by integrating both statistical frameworks and behavioral insights, with applications in matching platforms, healthcare practices, etc.</p>

<p>
I am actively looking for self-motivated graduate/undergraduate students. My research projects include design science for Information Systems and machine learning theory for Operations Management. Please feel free to send me an email if you would like to chat about potential opportunities!
