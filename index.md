<p>I am currently an Assistant Professor of Information Systems at <a href="https://wpcarey.asu.edu/">Arizona State University, W. P. Carey School of Business</a>. </p>

<p>My research lies at the intersection of machine learning and business analytics. I develop novel machine learning methods that establish theoretical foundations through statistical frameworks, and design new deep learning algorithms that enhance predictive and prescriptive performance informed by behavioral insights. These methodologies are applied to real-world datasets in collaboration with industry partners, with applications in matching platforms, healthcare problems, etc.</p>

<p>Previously, I completed my PhD degree from Department of Economics, University of Pennsylvania. I was fortunately advised by <a href="https://hamsabastani.github.io">Hamsa Bastani</a> from the Operations, Information, and Decisions Department, the Wharton School. I also received a B.S. in Mathematics and a B.A. in Economics from Tsinghua University, and a M.S. in Statistics from University of Chicago. </p>

<p>
I am actively seeking self-motivated undergraduate/graduate students/RAs/interns, who are interested in applying to Business PhD programs in Information Systems/Operations Management. My research projects spans areas such as design science (Information Systems) and machine learning theory (Operations Management). Please feel free to reach out via email if you would like to chat about potential opportunities!
